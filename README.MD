# BoardGame - Chess Squares Learning Game
Welcome to the BoardGame repository! Here, you'll find the code and instructions for hosting a game designed to enhance the learning experience of chess board squares.

The game was initially crafted in pure C and later transformed into a web application. You can explore the original C project [here](https://github.com/Vinigperuzzi/BoardApp).

This project represents a significant milestone for me, being my first major project. From project conception to design, it's was been a journey of learning and creativity, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JS.
